Prodigy InfoTech Task - 4

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview


This repository contains my solution for Task 04 of the Prodigy Infotech Internship. The task required building a simple keylogger in Python that captures keystrokes and logs them to a file for basic monitoring and testing purposes.

ðŸ“Š Objective


 Develop a Python-based keylogger that:

  1. Captures every key press made by the user.
  2. Logs the keystrokes into a .txt file in real-time.
  3. Runs in the background until manually stopped.
  4. Uses the pynput library for keyboard event handling.

Note: This keylogger is intended for educational and ethical use only. Always obtain consent before running such scripts on any device.
